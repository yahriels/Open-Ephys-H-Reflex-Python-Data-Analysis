SNARE-32
Recording 1: Stainless Steel Cuff Implanted. Ramp from low intensity in intervals of 0.10 mA. Fast Settle Enabled. HEADSCREW GROUND IN. Picoscope and output ground connected. 5 kHz Sampling
- Missed 1.10, 1.20 mA, was actually 1.0 mA
- 1.4 mA didn't register TTL Line Trigger.

Recording 2: Stainless Steel Cuff Implanted. Ramp from low intensity in intervals of 0.10 mA. Fast Settle Enabled. HEADSCREW GROUND IN. Picoscope and output ground connected. 5 kHz Sampling
- Repeat of 1.30 mA stim
- Potential offset of trig line
- Second 2.7/1.7 mA plot is the actual one.
