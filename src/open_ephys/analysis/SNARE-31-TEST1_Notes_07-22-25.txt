Experiment 1
Recording 1: PI Cuff Implanted. Ramp from low intensity in intervals of 0.05 mA. Fast Settle Enabled. HEADSCREW GROUND AND EEG OUT. 5 kHz Sampling. FIRST TEST

Starting at 0.00 mA

getting H-Wave at 0.45-0.50 mA

getting m-wave at 0.55-0.60 mA

getting f-wave at 0.70 mA

---------------------------



Recruitment onset at 0.45-0.50 mA

h-wave onset ~ 0.475 mA
m-wave onset ~ 0.535 mA

Recording 1: PI Cuff Implanted. Ramp from low intensity in intervals of 0.01 mA. Fast Settle Enabled. HEADSCREW GROUND AND EEG OUT. 5 kHz Sampling. FIRST TEST

in steps of 0.01 mA, until 1.00 mA, then changed to 0.05 mA
